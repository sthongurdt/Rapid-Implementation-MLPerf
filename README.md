# Rapid-Implementation-MLPerf
<div align="justify">
This is a recipe for a quick cross-platform implementation of MLPerf in Docker.

There are different ways to run benchmarks in MLPerf, Docker is one of the most widely used tools due to its ease of integration and automation..

**Docker** allows you to package and distribute MLPerf test environments as portable containers (Rapid deployment), simplifying the installation of dependencies and ensuring consistent environments. This option is ideal for users seeking rapid configuration or working in infrastructures where container-based virtualization is standard. With Docker, you can obtain official MLCommons images or build custom containers tailored to specific hardware or software needs.

- In the **Docker** directory you will find a recipe for a rapid x86-64 deployment.

# What's MLPerf?
<div align="justify">
MLPerf is a standardized benchmark suite widely recognized for evaluating the performance of hardware, software, and model systems in machine learning tasks. Developed by MLCommons, MLPerf provides reproducible metrics that allow systems to be compared under homogeneous conditions. The tests cover various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, object detection, and speech recognition, both in training and inference contexts. Its objective is to promote transparency and comparability in the development of artificial intelligence solutions, facilitating the choice of appropriate platforms and configurations based on user needs.
